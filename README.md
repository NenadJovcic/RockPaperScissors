## Project Overview

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple **console-based** application where players can compete against the computer. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of various Java design patterns in a practical application.

## Features

- Playable game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer
- Clear and structured code using Java design patterns

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java

## Design Patterns Implemented

- **Strategy Pattern:** For handling different moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- **Factory Pattern:** For creating instances of moves
- **Singleton Pattern:** For managing the game instance
- **Observer Pattern:** For tracking game events (optional)


## Game Mechanics

- **Controls:**
  - Players input their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) via the console.
  - The computer randomly selects its move.

- **Rules:**
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
  - If both moves are the same, the game is a tie.
